# Micrium_STM32F446RE
Porting Micrium OS on STM32 Nucleo Board F446RE.\n
The sourse code for micrium OS was obtained from the public repository
of Weston Embeded Solution, the official guardian of the Code.
A little about Micrium (uC/OS), it is a RTOS with a premptive realt time kernel,
witch countless applications and stack support such as TCP, IP, DHCP, CAN, Client, Server, FTP, HTTP...
The preemptive kernel aloows higher priorities task to stop the execution of lower priority stack,
and gain control until necessary as configurations;
In embedded system it becomes necessary to run safety and time critical operations to allow
the correct response to any    

Running a simple Blinking task.
